#Implementation and analysis of a real-time task-set managed by fixed-priority preemptive scheduling


IDE: VxWorks

Language: C 

In this project, we have studied how to simulate the execution of a task set in real-time in VxWorks by implementing a framework that also allows us to verify its properties.
In this work, we also analyzed the connection between the number of computations and the time taken, which allowed us to simulate the execution time of a task.
We then carried out simulations with a schedulable and a non-schedulable task set.
Finally, we verified the correctness of the schedulable task-set by using the ORIS1 tool.
